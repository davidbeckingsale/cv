\section{Research Experience}
  \cventry{2011--present}{University of Warwick}
    {Research Assistant}
    {}{}
    {
      Researched the use of  mini-applications in preparing existing production
      applications for future high-performance computing architectures.
      Including developing a shock hydrodynamics mini-application with adaptive
      mesh refinement, and porting this application to GPU-based architectures.

  \cventry{2011--present}{Atomic Weapons Establishment}
    {Research Intern}
    {}{}
    {
    Worked with members of AWE's Applied Computer Science team to develop
    mini-applications for hydrodynamics and heat conduction. Investigated new
    programming languages and models using these applications.
    }

  \cventry{Summer 2014}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}
    {Secondee}
    {}{}
    {
      Seconded to LLNL from the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment. Investigated
      programming models and performance analysis using representative
      mini-applications, and used machine learning techniques to identify optimal
      application execution configurations.
